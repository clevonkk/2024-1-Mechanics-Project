# 2024-1-Mechanics-Project
This program is made as term project of 2024-1 Mechanics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University. This consists of two projects.

0. One may need numpy package to run this program.
1. Project 1: This analyzes the chaotic motion of coupled pendulum, coupled by spring of constant k. One can adjust (i) mass of two pendulums, (ii) length of thread holding the pendulums, (iii) horizontal separation of pendulums, (iv) spring constant k, (v) initial values of the system. One can choose whether one simulates the system by (i) simply computing the values (position and velocity) of considering time instants -- mode 1, or (ii) generating the animation video -- mode 2.
2. Project 2: This analyzes the three-body system under gravitational forces. One can adjust (i) mass of three bodies and (ii) initial values of the system. Same as project 1, one can simulate the system by (i) simply computing the values (position and velocity) of considering time instants -- mode 1, or (ii) generating the animation video -- mode 2.
